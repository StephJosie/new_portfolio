<p>My name is Stephanie Apodaca. I am a single mom and currently work for Kaiser Permanente, San Diego.
    I have been interested in accomplishing a coding bootcamp for a few years, I was recently given the opportunity
    to attend one. I enjoy photography and dog rescue. I look forward to improving on my portfolio.
